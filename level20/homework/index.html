        well, thats is a stupid question what do you mean why? GOA will change your life like it did to me here is how it all happend, before i joined GOA i didnt really had a goal to follow i was just living typical school student life , wake up, go to school, come from school  then eat, play games for like 3 hours nonstop, then do my homework eat dinner go to sleep ans repeate. doesnt sound very pleasing doesnt it?

        when my friend and ex leader in goa told me to join goa i did and i dont regret a thing, after i joined i met people with the same goal and all friendly and ready to help you if you need it, and there are such a good coding lecturers if you dont get something first time they will explain 100 more times until u get it, they also make sure you get enough phisical exsercise for you to become obsolute CHAD

        GOA has a very uniqe style of teaching, they teach you in levels, just like in a lot of games there are levers here and one lecture is one level complite and your goal is to get to higher levels and progress, you can think of this as a video game but insted of level up in virtual world you level up in life.
